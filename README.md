# Exemple rest api
An example of the structure of the rest api of the server on express. Here I implemented the signin/signup/get/getAll of users.
>I do not recommend using sign in and sign up as implemented here. Redo it by adding jwt tokens here at least


Your suggestions on how to make the structure more convenient or correct are welcome
